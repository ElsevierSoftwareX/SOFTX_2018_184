# need
#   convert from Ration non-dyadic
#   convert to Real/Rat/Int (must be linked to simplify routine)
#       finite sequences are all dyadic points
#          can get upper bound of X_L and lower of X_R
#   division and reciprocals 
#   recognise and simplify, give names
#       perhaps, starting from Int
#   find simplest (earliest generation) form in equivalence class
#      sort(unique( )) when creating, to reduce growth of bits
#      other simplification rules???
#        can just replace X_L with max(X_L) and X_R with min(X_R) ????
#
#   work on transfinites
#         separate files
#
#   promote to use convert from numbers to surreals for calculations
