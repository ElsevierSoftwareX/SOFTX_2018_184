#   convert from Ration non-dyadic
#   division and reciprocals  - infinite set cases
#
#   find simplest (earliest generation) form in equivalence class
#        can just replace X_L with max(X_L) and X_R with min(X_R) ????
# 
#      - most of a above didn't work, but can convert to Rational and back
#      - in fact could do this for everything, bu kind of cheating
#
#   work on transfinites
#         separate files
#
#   promote to use convert from numbers to surreals for calculations
#      promote rationals and floats and ints to Surreals for calculations
